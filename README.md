# 📊 Bangladesh Bank Deposit Analysis

A full data analysis project to explore **district-wise bank deposits in Bangladesh**.  
The project covers descriptive statistics, comparative analysis, growth trends, inequality measures, geospatial heatmaps, and **animated time-series visualizations**.

## 🗂 Dataset Source

The deposit data used in this analysis was obtained from the Bangladesh government’s open data portal:  
[**data.gov.bd**](https://data.gov.bd/)

## 🚀 Features  

- **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
  - Handles messy files with unnamed columns and merged headers  
  - Standardizes key fields: `district`, `thana`, `year`, `quarter`, `deposits`

- **Descriptive Analysis**  
  - Total deposits by district & thana  
  - Average quarterly and yearly deposits  
  - Year-over-year growth percentages

- **Comparative Analysis**  
  - Urban vs. rural comparison  
  - Deposits by division  
  - Ranking of districts by total deposits

- **Trend & Seasonal Analysis**  
  - Changes over years and across quarters  
  - Seasonal effects (e.g., Q1 vs Q4)

- **Geospatial Heatmaps**  
  - Visual maps showing deposit distribution across districts  
  - Identification of underbanked vs. financial hub regions

- **Time-Series Forecasting**  
  - Forecast future deposits using historical data (ARIMA)  
  - Identify districts with strong or weak growth

- **Inequality Measures**  
  - Gini coefficient for deposit distribution  
  - Lorenz curves or concentration measures

- **Animations**  
  - GIFs to visualize yearly and quarterly trends over time
